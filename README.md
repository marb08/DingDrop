## üîπNew Feature: Readeck Integration

The bot now supports **Readeck** as a second service for saving bookmarks, alongside Linkding. When you send a link, the bot will prompt you to choose between **Linkding** or **Readeck**, and it will save the bookmark accordingly.

### üîß How to Enable Readeck Support

To enable Readeck, you need to rename specific files in your setup:

1. Locate all files with the `-dual` suffix in the project directory.
2. Remove the `-dual` suffix from their filenames.
3. Use these renamed files to run the bot.

This change ensures that the bot correctly recognizes and interacts with the Readeck APIs.

### üõ† Required Configuration

Make sure to add the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```ini
READECK_API_URL=<your-readeck-api-url>
READECK_API_TOKEN=<your-readeck-api-token>
```
> **üí° Remember:** Once these variables are set and the files renamed, it is necessay to rebuild the Docker image with the new Dockerfile provided.

Happy bookmarking! üöÄ
